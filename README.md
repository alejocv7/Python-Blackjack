# Python Blackjack

## SUMMARY
This project uses Python to create a Blackjack game for one player against an automated dealer (computer). The game’s algorithm is developed using Object Oriented Programming. On each turn, a player can choose to “stand” or “hit” and will be prompted of their wins and losses with an updated chip balance.
